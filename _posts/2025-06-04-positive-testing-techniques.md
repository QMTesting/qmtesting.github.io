Effective Test Case Design Strategies: Best practices
Test case design is a crucial step in the software testing process. It involves creating a set of test cases that will effectively validate the functionality and performance of a software application. Effective test case design strategies are essential for ensuring comprehensive testing and identifying any potential issues or bugs. The following are some best practices for test case design that can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your testing efforts.

1. Understand the Requirements
It is important to clearly understand the software requirements before designing test cases. This includes both functional and non-functional requirements. By thoroughly understanding the requirements, you can ensure that your test cases cover all the necessary scenarios and edge cases.

Start by reviewing the project documentation, such as the requirements specification, user stories, and use cases. If any ambiguities or gaps are identified, seek clarification from the project stakeholders. This will help you create test cases that accurately reflect the intended functionality of the software.

2. Identify Test Objectives
Test objectives define the purpose of each test case. They help testers understand what they are trying to achieve with each test and guide them in designing appropriate test scenarios. When identifying test objectives, consider the following:

Functional Coverage: Ensure that the test cases cover all the functional requirements.

Risk-based Testing: Identify high-risk areas of the software and prioritize test cases accordingly.

User Scenarios: Design test cases that mimic real-world user scenarios to validate the software's usability.

Boundary Conditions: Include test cases that test the limits and boundaries of the software's functionality.

3. Use Test Design Techniques
Test design techniques are systematic approaches to designing test cases. They help ensure that test cases are comprehensive and cover a wide range of scenarios. Some commonly used test design techniques include:

Equivalence Partitioning: Divide the input domain into equivalent classes and design test cases for each class.

Boundary Value Analysis: Test the boundaries and limits of input values to identify any issues.

Decision Table Testing: Create a decision table to capture different combinations of inputs and expected outputs.

State Transition Testing: Design test cases to validate the transitions between different states of the software.

By using these techniques, you can ensure that your test cases are well-designed and cover a wide range of scenarios, increasing the chances of finding defects in the software.

4. Keep Test Cases Simple and Independent
When designing test cases, it is important to keep them simple and independent. Each test case should focus on testing a specific functionality or scenario, making it easier to identify and isolate issues.

Avoid creating complex test cases that test multiple functionalities at once. This can make it difficult to pinpoint the cause of a failure if the test case fails. Instead, break down complex scenarios into smaller, independent test cases that can be executed and debugged individually.

5. Prioritize Test Cases
Not all test cases are created equal. Some test cases are more critical than others and should be given higher priority. Prioritizing test cases helps ensure that the most important functionalities are thoroughly tested.

Consider the impact and likelihood of failure when prioritizing test cases. High-impact functionalities that are critical to the software's core functionality should be tested more rigorously. Similarly, test cases that cover rare but high-risk scenarios should also be given higher priority.

When To Conduct Positive Testing
Positive testing is a pivotal phase in the software testing process, typically conducted when the application reaches a state deemed ready for testing. Once the software build is considered stable and functional, positive testing serves as the initial step in validating its expected behaviors.

The execution of positive testing marks a critical milestone in the testing lifecycle, signaling the readiness of the application for more comprehensive testing activities. Once positive testing is completed, testers can proceed with executing other planned scenarios, such as negative testing.

The positive testing phase, conducted upon the readiness of the build, is often referred to as Smoke testing. This serves as a quick verification process to ensure that the essential functionalities of the application are operational and meet the predefined acceptance criteria. Other terms used to describe this initial phase of test execution include build verification testing, sanity testing, or quality gate testing.

Positive testing serves as the foundational step in the overall test execution process, setting the stage for subsequent testing activities and providing essential feedback on the stability and functionality of the software.

Positive Testing Techniques
Positive testing uses specific techniques designed to effectively validate the expected behavior of software functionality.

The two commonly used techniques for positive testing are Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis.

Equivalence Partitioning
Equivalence partitioning (EP) is a method that divides test input into distinct partitions, each representing a range of valid or equivalent inputs. A partition containing valid values is called a valid partition, which is used for positive testing purposes.

EP focuses on coverage of items known as equivalence partitions. To achieve 100% coverage using this technique, test cases must include all identified partitions, including invalid partitions, ensuring each partition is covered at least once. Coverage is quantified by calculating the percentage of partitions exercised by at least one test case, divided by the total number of identified partitions.

EP Example:
If a field only accepts ages between 20 and 40, valid partitions could include ranges such as 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 35, and 36 to 40. Invalid partitions include less than or equal to 19 and greater or equal to 41.

When using the equivalence partitioning technique for positive testing, all of the test data is chosen from within each of the 4 valid partition ranges.

Boundary Value Analysis
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a technique based on exercising the boundaries of equivalence partitions. Therefore, BVA can only be used for ordered partitions.

The minimum and maximum values of a partition are its boundary values. In the case of BVA, if two elements belong to the same partition, all elements between them must also belong to that partition.

BVA focuses on the boundary values of the partitions because developers are more likely to make errors with these boundary values. Typical defects found by BVA are located where implemented boundaries are misplaced to positions above or below their intended positions or are omitted altogether.

BVA Example:
If a field accepts only ages between 20 and 40, all valid and invalid boundary values used for testing the field would include the following: 19, 20, 21, 39, 40, and 41.

When the input test data only includes values within the valid boundary range limits, positive testing is used to test the field.

Advantages of Positive Testing
1. Positive testing streamlines the testing process by focusing exclusively on valid and expected input scenarios, thus reducing overall testing time.

2. It guarantees fulfillment of all specified requirements, ensuring the final product functions flawlessly as designed.

3. By identifying faulty builds early on, Positive Testing conserves testing efforts and expedites the development cycle.

6. Compared with alternative testing methods, Positive Testing consistently yields a lower incidence of defects, highlighting its effectiveness.

7.This method excels in rigorously assessing the expected behavior of an application, providing reliable confirmation of its operational excellence.

Disadvantages of Positive Testing
1. Positive Testing deliberately focuses on executing test cases that are expected to pass.

2. It strategically avoids the exploration of product/application errors that occur outside of these designed scenarios.

3. Properly assigning valid data to each test case is crucial, as this guarantees comprehensive coverage.

4. Crafting positive test cases for extensive datasets demands a high degree of precision and expertise.

5. While this method doesn't guarantee complete product accuracy, it serves as an effective measure of expected functionality.

6. Despite being less comprehensive than Negative Testing, Positive Testing is vital in affirming software behavior under normal conditions.

Conclusion
Positive testing is the first step in the testing process, laying the groundwork for subsequent testing levels and activities. It validates the positive path of an application, ensuring that basic functionalities operate as intended and meet user requirements. While other testing types, such as negative testing, are essential for ensuring bug-free and stable software, positive testing serves as a foundational step in the overall testing process, providing valuable insights into the functionality and reliability of the software.
